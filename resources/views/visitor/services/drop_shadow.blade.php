        <h2 class="text-xl title-font font-medium mb-3">Types of shadow effect</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <strong>Drop Shadow:</strong> Drop Shadow means that the bottom shadow of any product image. Here we will process the image in a way that the original product has a shadow which we are able to either create or extend. For example, we have got a product with no shadow which looks a bit naked or incomplete, here we'd produce a drop shadow for the product taking bits from the original image and creating a half or quarter reflection at the bottom. Therefore, giving the image a finer and natural look. In total, the image will have a color shadow with a softened edge having that eye-catching view for the audience.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Drop shadow makes the object look like it's slightly raised above the background, almost floating. Sometimes, this also provides the object a faint glow. This method is usually used by eCommerce retailers to display online product photos.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <strong>Natural shadow:</strong> Natural shadow is the original shadow that is reflected by the product. Then the Shadow making Service is performed to smooth the edges of the shadow and creating the shadow bolder or lightweight depending on the necessities of the customer. This helps the image to appear more refined whereas keeping the natural look intact.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          The photo editor will select wherever the imaginative light is returning from and cast the shadow accordingly. This makes the object seem to be sitting on a surface.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <strong>Existing shadow or cast shadow:</strong> Sometimes, you’ll have a photo that has natural shadows in it, However, you would like to edit it and make a different background. In these cases, you'll preserve the naturally occurring shadow with the right levels of opacity and transparency. In some instances, you’ll get to recreate the original shadow by hand.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          <strong>Floating shadow and reflections:</strong> Floating shadow and floating reflections are another type of shadow effect. Reflection could be a mirror effect of the image which is the opposite of the image integrated into the same image. so within the case of reflection shadow, we can create a reflection of the product or extending the original or natural shadow of the image to possess a whole image in shadow type hooked up with the original image. This creates a reproduction of the image in the reflection of the image is a color type instead of the usual grey shadow.
